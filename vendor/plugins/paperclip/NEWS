  `Paperclip::Railtie` was intended to be used with Ruby on Rails only. If you're
  using Paperclip without Rails, you should include `Paperclip::Glue` into
  `ActiveRecord::Base` instead of requiring `paperclip/railtie`:

      ActiveRecord::Base.send :include, Paperclip::Glue

  has_attached_file calls:

      has_attached_file :avatar,
        :path => ":rails_root/public/system/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename",
        :url => "/system/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename"
